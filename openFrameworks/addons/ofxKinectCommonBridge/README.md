ofxKinectCommonBridge
=================

A wrapper for the simple Kinect for Windows library developed at Microsoft in partnership with myself &amp; James George

Starting the library is easy:

````
kinect.start();
````

This creates a 640x480 color image stream and 320x240 depth image stream. A more complex example looks like so:

````
kinect.initSensor(1); // open the 2nd sensor
//kinect.initIRStream(640, 480); // size, you can do IR or Color
kinect.initColorStream(640, 480); // size
kinect.initDepthStream(320, 240, true); // size and close range?
kinect.initSkeletonStream(true); // seated?
````

To update the Kinect, you guessed it:

````
kinect.update();
````

This handles updating all the streams you have initialized.

To draw, choose one or all of:

````
kinect.draw(0,0); // draw the color image
kinect.drawDepth(kinect.getColorPixelsRef().getWidth(), 0); // draw the depth image
````

To access the pixels of any image:

````
ofPixels colorPix = getColorPixelsRef();
ofPixels depthPix = getDepthPixelsRef();///< grayscale values
ofShortPixels rawDepthPix = getRawDepthPixelsRef();	///< raw 11 bit values
````

To get the screen locations of the skeletons and joints of those skeletons

````
if(kinect.isNewSkeleton()) {
		for( int i = 0; i < kinect.getSkeletons().size(); i++) 
		{
      			// has a head? probably working ok then :)
			if(kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).find(NUI_SKELETON_POSITION_HEAD) != kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).end())
			{
				// just get the first one
				SkeletonBone headBone = kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).find(NUI_SKELETON_POSITION_HEAD)->second;
				ofVec2f headScrenPosition( headBone.getScreenPosition().x, headBone.getScreenPosition().y);
				return;
			}
		}
	}

````

Gestures, Face-Tracking, and the Voice API are all on their way.

As of yet 32bit only and, as this is leveraging the Kinect for Windows library, Windows only.

#projectGenerator Help

If you are using the project generator to create your ofxKinectCommonBridge projects, you may notice that your projects don't compile and throw errors about "Cannot open include file "NuiApi.h", etc. This is because there are a few additional settings that you must add to the Visual Studio project after generating that the projectGenerator currently can't add for you.

So, once you have generated a project that includes ofxKinectCommonBridge:

- Right click on the name of your solution in the Solution Explorer in Visual studio and select "Properties" at the bottom.
- Ensure that "All Configurations" is selected in the Configuration drop down on the top left

- Under **VC++ Directories > All Options**
  - Add the following to *Include Directories*
  
    ````
    $(KINECTSDK10_DIR)inc
    $(KINECT_TOOLKIT_DIR)inc
    ````
        
  - Add the following to *Library Directories*
  
    ````
    $(KINECTSDK10_DIR)\lib\x86
    ````
    
- Under **Linker > All Options**
  - add the following to *Additional Library Directories*
    
        ````
        ..\..\..\addons\ofxKinectCommonBridge\libs\KinectCommonBridge\lib\windows
        ````
    
  - add the following under *Additional Dependencies*
  
	    ````
        KinectCommonBridge.lib
        Kinect10.lib
	    ````

- Under **Build Events > Post Build Event**
  - add the following to *Command Line*

	````
    xcopy /e /i /y "$(ProjectDir)..\..\..\export\vs\*.dll" "$(ProjectDir)bin"
    xcopy /e /i /y "..\..\..\addons\ofxKinectCommonBridge\libs\KinectCommonBridge\lib\windows\*.dll" "$(ProjectDir)bin"
    ````
    
May require some modification for your specific machine...

# Using Property Sheets to do all these settings automatically

If you have used the Project Generator to create your project, you can use this route to add all the necessary settings for your project (e.g. include paths, libraries, build steps for copying necessary dll's).

- Open the *Property Manager* for your *Solution* (**View > Other Windows > Property Manager**)
  - Right click on your project (e.g. `emptyExample`) and select **Add Existing Property Sheet...**
  - Select the file `addons\ofxKinectCommonBridge\ofxKinectCommonBridge.props`

 Face Tracking and Speech
================================================================================================================================================================

Hi there!

Right now the Face Tracking and Speech detection require that you have the Professional versions of Visual Studio. If you'd like to enable them, go to [ofxKinectCommonBridge.h](https://github.com/joshuajnoble/ofxKinectCommonBridge/blob/master/src/ofxKinectCommonBridge.h) and uncomment one or both of these:

```cpp
//#define KCB_ENABLE_FT
//#define KCB_ENABLE_SPEECH
```

OR (and even better)

Add to your Command Line arguments in Project Properties, it's in C++ properties.

You'll also need to change your linker settings just a little so that you're linking against:

```cpp
ofxKinectCommonBridge/libs/KinectCommonBridge/lib/windows/vs_Speech
```

instead of 

```cpp
ofxKinectCommonBridge/libs/KinectCommonBridge/lib/windows/vs
```

A pain, I know, but I had to compile the KinectCommonBridge library differently to get everything we needed included without breaking it for other folks.

FaceTracking is pretty straight forward:

```cpp
kinect.initFaceTracking()
```

then in the update() method, call getFaceData()

```cpp
kinect.update();
if(kinect.isFaceNew()) {
	face = kinect.getFaceData();
}
```

The face is a bit rough still so caveat emptor, but it works ok and tracks 2 face simultaneously.

Speech is a little more complex. You need a few things:

```cpp
#define KCB_ENABLE_SPEECH // uncomment this
```

Then in your setup:

```cpp
void testApp::setup()
{

	string grammarPath = ofToDataPath("grammar\\SpeechBasics-D2D.grxml", true); // you need a grammar file, more on that later
	kinect.setSpeechGrammarFile(grammarPath);
	kinect.initSpeech();
	kinect.start();
	
	ofAddListener(ofxKCBSpeechEvent::event, this, &testApp::speechEvent);
}
```

Then a listener:

```cpp
void testApp::speechEvent( ofxKCBSpeechEvent & speechEvt )
{
	cout << " got speech event " << endl;
	cout << " detected " << speechEvt.detectedSpeech << endl;
	cout << " confidence " << speechEvt.confidence << endl;
}
```

So, you're probably wondering: what's the detected speech? It's going to be a tag. What's a tag? It's a tag defined in your Grammar file. What's a grammar file? A grammar file defines what yoa  is listening for. Here's something pretty simple:

```cpp
<grammar version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US" root="rootRule" tag-format="semantics/1.0-literals" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar">
  <rule id="rootRule">
    <one-of>
      <item>
	<!-- can be flexible -->
        <tag>FORWARD</tag>
        <one-of>
          <item> forwards </item>
          <item> forward </item>
          <item> straight </item>
        </one-of>
      </item>
      <item>
        <tag>BACKWARD</tag>
	<!-- can be flexible -->
        <one-of>
          <item> backward </item>
          <item> backwards </item>
          <item> back </item>
        </one-of>
      </item>
      <item>
        <tag>LEFT</tag>
        <one-of>
          <item> turn left </item>
        </one-of>
      </item>
      <item>
        <tag>RIGHT</tag>
        <one-of>
          <item> turn right </item>
        </one-of>
      </item>
    </one-of>
  </rule>
</grammar>
```

You can build much more complex ones, of course.
